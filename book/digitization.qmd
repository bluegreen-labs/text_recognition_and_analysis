# Digitization {#sec-digitization}

Although this reference manual focuses on text recognition and analysis it is important to note that digitization, and the quality of the images and the consistent collection of meta-data, is key to all subsequent processing. If you start a project where the digitization is not yet completed you should consider the importance of the digitization step within the context of all subsequent post-processing and text recognition workflows.

The quality of the collected image data and the availability of meta-data has a profound impact on your workflow. Preemptively addressing image quality and meta-data issues can save significant time and effort, even when taking up some more time in planning and data collection.

Common issues are the introduction of noise and lack of contrast of the text due to bleed through of the structure of the paper, or data on the other side of a page. Within the context of COBECORE a quick comparison between using either a black or white matte background showed a large jump in the noise level for a black matte. A white matte background was used in the final digitization to boost contrast.

## Basic digitization equipment

A basic digitization setup consists of:

- a digital camera (DSLR or mirrorless equivalent) and high quality optics (~1000 EURO)
- a [tripod with a horizontal boom](https://www.kentfaith.nl/KF09.086_94%22-240cm-camera-statief-lichtgewicht-reisstatief-22lbs-10kg-belasting-met-afneembare-monopod-voor-dslr-%20slr) or a reproduction table (~150 EURO)
- a (ring) light setup or plenty of available (natural) light casting no shadows, do not use flash lights (~50 EURO)
- a background matte (<10 EURO)
- a fixation option to keep data records in place (think of magnets, binder klips etc.) (<10 EURO)

The most basic setup will cost you less than 1500 EURO. Using a good reproduction table and cold lights will cost more, but does not necessarily yield better results.

## General guidelines

In addition to the physical setup of the camera and lights, you will need a computer with sufficient storage capacity and a (institutional) backup solution. To ensure consistent digitization a protocol should be written to detail a fixed sequence of tasks, including the collection of meta-data. Finally, if these aspects are not within your domain of expertise reach out to your local collection managers for support and input!
