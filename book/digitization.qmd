Although this course focuses on text recognition and analysis it is important to note that image acquisition, the quality of the images and the consistent collection of meta-data is key to all subsequent processing. If you start a project where the digitization is not yet completed you should consider the importance of the digitization step within the context of all subsequent post-processing and text recognition workflows.

The quality of the collected image data and the availability of meta-data has a profound impact on your workflow. Preemptively addressing image quality and meta-data issues can save significant time and effort, even when taking up some more time in planning and data collection.

Some general guidelines for digitization therefore include:

- ensuring a proper digitization setup
  - high quality optics (high f-stop value for sharpness)
  - uniform shadowless illumination using multiple lights and ring lights
  - avoid harsh flash based setups (protecting sensitive manuscripts)
- ensuring a fixed digitization protocol
  - fixed sequence of tasks involved
  - well documented
  - collect meta-data when feasible
- ensuring dynamic back-ups to prevent data loss

Finally, if not within your domain expertise reach out to your local collection managers for support and input on all these aspects.
