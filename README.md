# Text Recognition & Analysis

Understanding or translating large volumes of handwritten historical text is critical for historical analysis preservation of text, dissemination of knowledge and valorization of archived measurements and/or other scientific observations. However, reading and processing these large volumes of historical texts (at scale) is often difficult and time consuming. The automation of this process would therefore help in many historical analysis, data recovery and other digital preservation efforts.

Handwritten text recognition (HTR), contrary to optical character recognition (OCR) for typed texts, is a relatively complex process. Handwritten text (or old fonts) are surprisingly varied, with characters varying from one person (or book) to the next. These variations make HTR/OCR at times an intractable problem.
